# Atomic orbitals
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/2JuG58yBdWg
#### Description:
The project draws the atomic orbitals of a chemical element. It allows the user to select a chemical element from the periodic table and it draws all the orbitalls corresponding the the number of electrons of that element. It only plots orbitals up to

#### References
For making this project, the following resources where very helpfull:
* [hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html#c3) Normalized Hydrogen Wavefunctions, incredibly helpfull, shows simple, easy to understand solutions to the Schrodinger equation, which is incredibly complicated (the solutions are up to "n" quantum number n=3)

* [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Orbitals_table) on Wikipedia, shows a lot of useful and interesting information about orbitals

* [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) on Wikipedia, offers some more information

* [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/158487/function-that-magnifies-small-changes-and-compresses-large-changes) math.stackexchange question and answer, which shows how to make a function that increases small number a lot, but barely increases large numbers (usefull to increase the intensity of barely visible areas in the drawing, but without increasing already visible areas)
